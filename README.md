# Apple-Store-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-and-Data-Cleaning-

## Overview

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning on existing datasets from the Apple Store. The primary objective is to gain insights and provide recommendations for a fictional stakeholder or client who is developing a new app for the Apple Store. By analyzing the data, we aim to assist in making informed decisions related to app development, pricing, and genre selection.

## Project Goals

1. **Combine Datasets:** Merge multiple datasets containing Apple Store app descriptions into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Identify the number of unique apps in the combined dataset.
   - Check for missing values in key fields.
   - Explore the distribution of apps across different genres.
   - Analyze the overall rating landscape of the existing apps.
   - Examine the distribution of app prices.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Investigate whether paid apps tend to have higher ratings compared to free apps.
   - Explore the relationship between the number of supported languages and app ratings.
   - Identify genres with lower average ratings.
   - Examine if there is a correlation between the length of app descriptions and user ratings.
   - Identify the top-rated apps for each genre.

4. **Conclusions:**
   - Summarize key findings and provide actionable insights for a potential app developer entering the Apple Store market.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL:** Utilized SQL queries for data cleaning, combining datasets, and performing exploratory and analytical tasks.
- **sqliteconnection.com:** Leveraged the online SQLite platform for executing SQL queries and exploring the dataset.

## How to Use

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure the availability of datasets (`appleStore_description1`, `appleStore_description2`, `appleStore_description3`, `appleStore_description4`, and `AppleStore`).
   - Run the SQL script to combine datasets and prepare the data for analysis.

2. **EDA and Data Analysis:**
   - Execute SQL queries provided in the script for exploratory data analysis and data cleaning.
   - Explore the results to gain insights into the existing Apple Store app landscape.

3. **Conclusions:**
   - Review the conclusions section for summarized findings and recommendations.

Feel free to adapt the SQL queries or further customize the analysis based on specific requirements.

## Results

The results of the analysis, including key insights and conclusions, can be found in the corresponding sections of the README.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive overview of the Apple Store app ecosystem, aiming to guide potential app developers in making informed decisions. The combination of EDA and Data Analysis using SQL offers valuable insights into factors influencing app success and user ratings.
